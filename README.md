The project workflow shown in the figure above, where a hybrid power system sends real-time system data to the cloud storage initially. In this project the task is to fetch the data from cloud storage through REST API with authentication and design a user-friendly dashboard to visualize the system overview such as current power consumption, remaining fuel for generator and battery charging status etc. to the system owner.


** Dashboard Layout: ** The dashboard below shows the screenshot of actively running application containing battery, fuel tank and power consumption status.
